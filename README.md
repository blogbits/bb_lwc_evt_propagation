# Lightning Web Components and Event Propagation

Code used to demonstrate the different behaviors of LWC event propagation, event re-targeting, event data passing and name collisions.  Code is part of a [blog post](https://www.kleencut.net/blog/lwc-evt-propagation) on LWC events propagation.

This project created with  [lwc-create-app](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/lwc-create-app).


The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/modules`](./src/modules) folder.


## To get started

```
npm i
```

```
This will start the project with a local development server.
